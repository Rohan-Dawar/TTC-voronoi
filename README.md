# Creating a Voronoi Map of the Toronto Subway System
## Author [Rohan Dawar](https://www.rohandawar.com/)

### A [Voronoi Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) is a plane consisting of points and polygons.
### The polygons, or Voronoi Cells surrounding each point represent the area closer to that point than another point on the plane.
### Essentially, all area within a polygon X is more proximal in Eucliadian distance to point X than to any other point.
### In this project I have created a voronoi map, both in Geopandas and Folium, of the Toronto Subway System, with points corresponding to subway stations.
### The resulting map shows us which subway station is closest to any area in the city, and can be used for further analysis!
